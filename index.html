        <h3>An Introduction</h3>
        <p>
                Hello visitors! My name is Ramzi Maducdoc.
                This webpage is the result of hours of struggling and months of preparation.
                After much time of delay from a stressful senior year of high school,
                I finally got around to making this webpage.
                This webpage is my final product for my senior project, 
                a six month long project that seniors at Hoover High school
                in Glendale, California are to complete.
                </p>

            What is this?
            </h3>   
            <p>
            Currently this blog is moreso a passion project in addition to a personal website for my future career.
            Who knows where it could go? It could end up being a portfolio for my future career, a blogging website where I post 
            content that I am interested in, it could be anything I wanted it to be.
            For now, it's a blank canvas, and where it goes is completely up to me. For now, let me tell you a little about myself and how I got here.

        <h3>My Senior Project</h3>
        <p>I am currently a senior at Hoover High School and every senior is required to complete a senior project in which they set out to learn something new.
            I decided to learn programming as my project because it was something that had always interested me.
            As a kid, I loved technology and I knew that I wanted to be around it as much as possible.
            I learned HTML and CSS mainly through Codecademy, and in a few months time I was able to put all this together. In its current state it's not amazing, but factoring in my senior year and five AP classes, I think I did a decent job.

        <h3>What will be on this website?</h3>
        <p>Like I said, for now I'm not so sure. Right now I'm still quite learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and so far it's just been me toying around with settings and looking up tutorials online.
            Maybe I'll upload content about things I am passionate about, but for now I want to actually get this website online.
